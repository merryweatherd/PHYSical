\arguments{
\item{x}{}

\item{ap_threshold}{threshold voltage for detecting action potential. default is -20mV.}

\item{iStep_window}{indices representing the entire current step. defaults to ~650ms - 1250ms window, which is Derek's default. adjust your window accordingly.}

\item{baseline_window}{indices representing the baseline window that is used for calculation. defaults to first 600ms of each sweep, which is Derek's default. adjust your window accordingly.}

\item{sliding_window}{how much time the rolling window covers in ms}
}
\value{
returns array of slope values from start of current step to first action potential in rheobase trace
